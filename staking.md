# Staking

CoinToFish has a Staking system that allows you to increase your corals by making a contract to lock them for a certain amount of time.

* The amount of time the corals will be blocked is **30 days**.
* The amount of reward for the 30-day block is **15%** of the total amount of blocked corals.

Let's show an example of how to do staking in CoinToFish:

The first thing is to go to the "Inventory" tab and click on the "Staking" window on the right side of your balance.

A window will appear where we can enter an amount of tokens. You will see information about the people who are staking and the amount of total remaining tokens that are destined to this task.

**Important**: The current profit percentage is **15%** but we may increase or decrease it over time. In these cases, don't worry because you will not be affected by the new changes. Your staking reward will be the same as it was at the time you locked the tokens.
