# First Steps

Once you have connected your metamask wallet ðŸ¦Š with our site, you only need to **obtain fish** to be able to perform the various functions of **CTF**. Players will be able to buy ðŸ¥š eggs in our store. Depending on the game you will have a percentage or another of obtaining fish with different rarities. The eggs will have a price in the marketplace: Normal egg: **3500 corals.** Rare egg: **7500 corals.**
