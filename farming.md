# Farming

Each fish will need to be fed every 4 hours. There will be a **100%** chance of getting corals for each feeding. To feed it you will have to click on the green button indicated in the following image.

A window will open with a drop-down menu to choose the food we want to feed the fish.

You can check the amount of food consumed by each fish at [Fish Wiki](broken-reference)â€‹

By choosing a food and clicking on the "**Feed**" icon your fish will fill 50% of the feed bar and start a counter that will warn you when the bar is completely empty.

Fish that has fed 2 times.

Since the feeding has to be done every 4 hours, we thought it would be best to give the user the possibility to accumulate up to 2 shifts so that you can adapt **CoinToFish** to your daily life. **Important Note**: If you feed a fish that has 70% of its bar available, don't worry, the whole bar will not be emptied, only 50% corresponding to each feeding, leaving the bar at 20% feeding.

**(We are planning to implement a 30% chance to receive double the amount of corals per feeding).**
