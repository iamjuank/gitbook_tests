# Withdraw

Many of you want to know how CoinToFish's Withdraw system works, here we explain it.

The withdraw system works on an individual basis, each person will have a different fee depending on how long he/she has been waiting between withdrawals.

We know that when panic situations are generated, people can be influenced to sell. Our way to counteract these situations is as follows:

The Withdraw rate will start from 75%. Every day it will be reduced by 5% until it reaches the minimum, 5%. 60% of the withdraw rate will go to burn token, which will result in a significant increase in value. So when a person panic sells, something that should hurt the market, he will be benefiting the CTFT token, since if the rate is high, he will be contributing to burn a lot of tokens.

Every day is reduced by 5% which would be the withdraw rate:

Once we remove it, the day counter will start again.

* Case 1: If I wait 5 days, my fee will be 75-25 (5\*5), a total of 60%.
* Case 2: If I wait 14 days, my fee will be the **minimum 5%**.

\-In the first case, when withdrawing 100 corals to tokens, a fee of 50 would be applied for only waiting 5 days, of which 60% will be used for burning, a total of 30 tokens burned, a very good amount, making hasty withdrawals raise the value of the token significantly. -In the second case, waiting the 14 days, a minimum fee of 5% would be applied.

You will be able to withdraw a minimum of 100. You can withdraw every 1 hour.
