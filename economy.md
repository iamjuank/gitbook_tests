# Economy

Players will have the governance of the economy in CoinToFish. They will choose the average price of the meals published in the store. Food is an essential commodity for the development of your fish. Without it you won't get very far, so fishing becomes vital in cointofish. You will also be able to take eggs to increase your equipment! Remember that the maximum is 35. In case you don't want to fish you can always buy food from others.

Each player chooses the price at which he/she wants to sell.

Therefore, if your priority is for your fish to level up very quickly, you should focus on **bread**, and if you are not in such a hurry, you can opt for apples or seaweed. Remember that when you level up your fish will get a 5% increase in the value of tokens generated by feeding. It is also important for future PVP to have higher level fish so don't sleep. Soon we will implement a new Fusion system that will allow you to combine fish and food pieces to further enhance the experience of your marine friends.
