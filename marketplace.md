# Marketplace

(Open from day 5 of the CTFT launch)

You will be able to **sell** your fish by listing them so that someone else can **buy** them. You will also be able to buy fish from someone else to start making profits.

Tools that will make it easier for you to find fish:

* Filter by rarity
* Filter by level
* Filter by chroma
* Filter by price
* Filter by identifier

The cost for listing your fish on the marketplace will be **1%** of the price you put, and 20 corals for removing it from the market, once the fish is sold, a part will go to **burning tokens**.
